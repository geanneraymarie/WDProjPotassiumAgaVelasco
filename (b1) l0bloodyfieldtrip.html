                <p>"The duty of solving cases that everyone else has abandoned falls to me, the man with the highest grades in BLUE's history."
                <br><br>And yet, despite all of his achievements, he was expelled.<br><br>Expelled for a crime he did not commit.<br><br>
                Ron panicked and fought hard as he was getting arrested, as he was taken away from the bloodied bodies they claim he killed.
                He couldn't defend himself, his memory failed him. He had no recollection whatsoever of what happened, and all he saw as he tried
                so hard to remember was the weapon in his hand, and the corpses that surrounded him.<br><br>As he was medically examined, a "96"
                scar was found on his neck, from where it came from, he didn't recall. It was also discovered that he had somehow been bound to a
                curse that would haunt him -- Kill on Sight, they called it. Should he ever solve a case once again, upon meeting the culprit, he
                would hypnotize them to death subconsciously, and when he came to, he'd have no recollection of it happening.<br><br>He was expelled,
                humiliated, and he was legally and morally forbidden to be a detective -- for he thought, what sort of detective kills as the very
                criminals they hunt down do?<br><br>At the very least, it was passed off as temporary insanity, helping him avoid the death penalty.
                His passion was taken away from him, for should he be found involved in cases once again, he'd surely get the death penalty this time.
                <br><br>Although, in his mind, perhaps it would've been better if he did get it instead.<br><br>5 years pass in isolation. He stuck
                within his residence in Japan, refusing to enter society. His neighbors would buy his groceries, and his only company was a cat. 
                His entire floor was covered in cushion, like an asylum he'd personally confined himself to.<br><br>However, a few people never did
                lose faith in him.<br><br>One of these people was Kiku, his classmate's father, a police officer. Kiku would have young recruits go
                to Ron for help should cases that appear unsolvable ever turn up, in hopes that Ron's spark might ignite once again. Unfortunately,
                he'd failed . . .<br><br>Until clueless young officer Totomaru Isshiki was sent to Ron.</p>

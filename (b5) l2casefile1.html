                    <p>“Kamonohashi Sweets here! I’ve got your morning snacks!” 

                    <br/><br/><br/>Ron arrived quickly after Toto got to the crime scene Amamiya called him over to. 

                    <br/>“I had some help from your phone’s GPS and the bug Spitz planted on you.” Ron informed Toto.
                    </p>

                <div id="button2" style="display:none">
                    <p>They finally look up and see the actual corpse – impaled upon the horn of a unicorn statue, now drenched in blood. A message was left behind.

                    <br/><br/>“And in those days, men seek death, and shall not find it, and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.”

                    <br/><br/>“It’s the revelation of St. John.” Ron stated. “Toto… this case is different from the ones we’ve had so far.”


                    <br/><br/><br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/><br/><br/>“The victim’s cause of death was blood loss. We think the culprit looped a rope over the arch and used it as a pulley to lower the victim onto the statue, but we can’t figure out how the killer escaped after the murder… Nobody was able to enter the facility last night. Sensors detected no suspicious entry or exit. The security guard in charge finished his rounds by midnight, but the estimated time of death is 2 am.” The police had claimed.

                    <br/>After talking with Ron, Toto was ready to explain how the murder worked.

                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“The culprit suspended the victim from this arch, but they didn’t hang him. The culprit made the victim support his full body weight by himself directly over the unicorn horn. The victim held on so he wouldn’t fall until he gave out. 2am was when he lost strength.”</button>

                <div id="button3" style="display:none">
                    <p>The police later identified the victim as Ryouji Katsunami, age 32. He was a member of the hacking group that were suspects in the recent cryptocurrency theft. They took off his clothes because they were told a mole on his chest could be used to identify him, but they instead discovered a scar that looks like a burn on the nape of his neck.

                    <br/><br/>Ron rushed to check it, discovering a sign. <a href= “https://ph.pinterest.com/f1929804-7d58-496b-b8a8-28af4c3d8be2”></a>

                    <br/><br/>“The passage they left near the victim… is the same as the wound on my neck. Revelation Chapter 9: Verse 6. This is unmistakably the M. Family. Moreover, this is a direct challenge from them to me…!” Ron exclaimed. 
                    <a href=”https://ph.pinterest.com/33c200b2-64bb-42dd-9f67-35bb40a92237”></a>
                    <br/><br/><br/>“...they’re mocking me.” He admitted with a grim tone in his voice.

                    <br/><br/><br/>“It feels the same as the bloody field trip.”

                    <br/>“The burn mark… is an announcement of the next murder! Says officer Isshiki” He announced.

                    <br/><br/>Ron whispered to Toto, “The victim’s biggest mistake was making the cryptocurrency theft widely known. If there was someone who had their eye on the enormous profit they made from the theft, then they’d be enraged over that massive loss, and their wrath would fall on the entire hacker group.”

                    <br/>Little did he know that the M family was already watching him at that moment.

                    <br/>For after all, he was a forbidden child – a descendant of both the Holmes and Moriarty families.

                    <br/><br/><br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/><br/><br/>“They’re making a challenge to me, and there’s no point if I can’t get there soon, so it should be near. The two other hackers escaped. The M family helped them, but their true motive was to kill them before the police got to the hackers first.”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“Police officers are stationed at various places with zero in their name.”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button4" style="display:none">
                    <p>“While I agree that zero refers to the location, I doubt the M family would make it so easy.” He thought.

                    <br/><br/>On the way, they encounter Chikori. They brainstorm more places, and Chikori suggests that there’s a “Platform 0” at the Shibuya station bus terminal. Ron lets them go ahead, while he stays behind.

                    <br/><br/>“It’s bugging me that the four corners aren’t connected on the first zero.”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()"> “They must’ve just made a mistake. I’m going!”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button5" style="display:none">
                    <p>After further thought on the odd zero, he finally realized the message. He quickly dialed Toto.

                    <br/>“It’s the scramble crossing! The four missing corners are the areas where there’s no pedestrian crossing paint!”

                    <br/><br/><br/>Tick. tock.

                    <br/><br/><br/>10:00.

                    <br/><br/><br/>Then suddenly, gas emerged from vents, coating the crossing in smoke, preventing clear vision. But when the gas faded, a corpse was already in the middle.

                    <br/>An arrow pierced through the man’s heart – the second hacker.

                    <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/20/d6/86/20d686625443ed60714c07ef7c746a64.jpg"></a>

                    <br/>However, how could anyone make a perfect shot through the smoke screen?

                    <br/><br/>“No way… they got Hibino…” A man shrieked and ran away – the third hacker.

                    <br/><br/>Before Ron could even process his disappointment in himself for cracking the code too late, he noticed yet another code on the arrow.
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“I lost him!” </button>
                </div>

                <div id="button6" style="display:none">
                    <p>Spitz popped out from nowhere and responded, “The hacker is in here, Tototo!”

                    <br/><br/>The hacker, Kizo Takanashi, was in a net, begging to be saved. He was offering to give up everything he stole, just to be saved from the cruel torturous hands of the M family. He had the cryptocurrency onto a cold wallet before the police could get to him.

                    <br/>“It was all his direction, he said he’d tell us how to escape but now my partners are being killed one by one…”

                    <br/><br/><br/>“Who was he?” Ron asked. 

                    <br/><br/><br/>The hacker thought, “He called himself Marry Ito.”

                    <br/><br/><br/>“That’s an anagram of Moriarty.”

                    <br/>“He’s calling me! Sh-Should I answer it?”

                    <br/><br/>“Put it on speaker.”

                    <br/>“You saw Hibino’s fate at the crosswalk, right? Bring a cold wallet with all the money you stole to the Delta hotel at 11. If you tell the police about this, our deal ends, and you’ll be as good as dead.”

                    <br/>The hacker panicked, fearing for his life. His previous companions had been impaled and shot by an arrow – anxiety and agitation ensuing. 

                    <br/><br/><br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/><br/><br/>“I’ve disposed of two of the hackers. Ron Kamonohashi doesn’t suspect a thing. The third one is next.” Winter said in a call.

                    <br/>“Don’t underestimate him.”

                    <br/><br/><br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/><br/><br/>“We’ll stop the M family this time…” He has no place to snipe from between the hotel’s structure and the security detail. But… I feel uneasy. It’s like I’m missing something. Ron thought.

                    <br/>On the other hand, the Moriartys had figured out that the police were told about the plan. Kizo would get killed soon.

                    <br/>“I’ve gotta give him this wallet! I can still make it!” Kizo panicked, running off to the hotel lobby. Right as he crossed the lobby, the chandelier snapped and fell…

                    <br/><br/><br/>But Toto was able to pull Kizo away in time. 
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“We weren’t able to arrest the culprit, but at least we saved the victim’s life…”</button>

                    <p>Music. “It’s Haydn’s 96th-” A grave expression crossed Ron’s face upon realizing the numbers.

                    <br/><br/>“We played right into their hands!”

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“Haydn’s 96th symphony is known as the “Miracle Symphony” because a chandelier fell during its premiere performance, but nobody was hurt.” Toto relayed.</button>

                <div id="button8" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Does that mean the killer had already anticipated that we’d save the hacker?”

                    <br/><br/>Toto nodded. 

                    <br/><br/>Amamiya added, “Apparently, the metal in the tip of the arrow the murderer used at the scramble crossing was iridium. It’s not lethal, so why use such a rare metal? We also haven’t figured out how they shot the arrow in the smokescreen… I’ll take the hacker back to HQ and place him under guard, he’ll be safe there. I’ll also make sure the investigation goes on.”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“Ron, why do you think the M family didn’t kill the hacker?”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button9" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Who knows? I do know where we need to go next.” He pulled out a tablet he found behind the hotel’s music player.
                    <br/><br/>“Iridium is group 9, period 6 on the periodic table. Haydn’s 96th, Revelation Chapter 9, Verse 6… all of the crimes are connected to the 96 on my neck. The M family is targeting me with these murders!”

                    <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1f/30/30/1f303045d3b0f604e33188b99be6222b.jpg"></a>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“the H was a symbol for the heliport!”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button10" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron affirmed. “Yep. This is the only nearby one.”

                    <br/>They quickly made their way up Shibuya City View Tower, getting through security first to reach the heliport. The roof was closed for inspection, but since Toto’s with the police, he managed to get past.

                    <br/>However, as they reached the rooftop, two unconscious bodies greeted them… along with the hacker?!

                    <br/>Marry Ito calls once again, and Kizo quickly gives them the provided phone.

                    <br/>“There’s no room for negotiation, Kamonohashi. As warned, you’ll taste despair at 12 noon. A detective’s despair.”

                    <br/><br/>Beep.

                    <br/><br/>Finally, Ron figured out the scramble crossing murder, although he had to drink some brown sugar syrup first to relax.

                    <br/>“The whooshing sound before the arrow struck misled us. If you think about it, if the killer was far away, he wouldn’t even need a smokescreen, and since he did, he was there. He stabbed the victim with the arrow, and he could’ve used something else, like a whip, to create the whooshing sound.” Ron explained.
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“So that means the killer was at the crime scene?!”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button11" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Exactly! That’s why you need to remember if you saw anyone suspicious.”</p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“I can’t really remember, I would’ve if I did see someone suspicious…”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button12" style="display:none">
                    <p>Kizo added, “I wasn’t thinking to look around while my life was in danger!”

                    <br/>Suddenly, Ron squeezed the brown sugar syrup and splashed it onto them.
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“Hey, Ron!-”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button13" style="display:none">
                    <p>“I’ll wipe it away with this!” He pulled out a handkerchief and gripped Kizo’s face.

                    <br/>“...your silly performance… and this disguise!” He pulled off the fake face worn by Winter Moriarty all along.

                    <br/>“It seemed impossible that the triangle referred to an actual shape painted somewhere, unlike the code for the scramble crossing. We figured it out because we overheard the hacker’s call with the culprit, but the conversation was unusually onesided. The fact that the hacker’s movements were controlled enough for the chandelier to drop right when he was below it, means that the hacker was either helping the culprit, or that… the hacker was the culprit.” Ron continued.

                    <br/>“But have you forgotten?” Winter asked, “I said you would taste despair at noon.”

                    <br/>Ron checked the phone given, which showed “12:00” on the time already.

                    <br/>And as if on cue, BOOM!


                    <br/><br/><br/>An explosion resounded through the atmosphere.

                    <br/><br/>As they tried to call Amamiya, Winter added, “The two of you are completely cut off from the outside, and Amamiya also has bombs strapped to her. She’s with the hacker. You know, Kamonohashi, you have no idea how much I’d enjoy killing you know if I could, but being that we are Moriartys, we must engage you in a battle of wits. We’ll give you a detective’s true despair.”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“Damn you, I’ll never forgive y-!”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button14" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Toto, wait! Amamiya and the hacker are still alive! If he won’t kill me because he wants to give me a detective’s despair, which means being unable to solve a problem, this means this problem can still be solved! The code still holds a mystery for us!”
</p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“What about that explosion?!”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button15" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron quickly responded, “That was a dummy! He said he wrapped them in explosives, but never said that they died from it!” He glanced down at the burning building.

                    <br/><br/>“...I see. So that’s it. I was totally fooled… Toto!” He exclaimed, “It’s not 12 o’clock yet!”</p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“What did you say?!”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button16" style="display:none">
                    <p>“The phone was provided by them. They changed the time to be ahead of the actual time! And look! He concealed the actual time from our view… because the explosion was on the building, specifically in the screen that showed the time!”
</p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“Then what’s the real time right now?!”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button17" style="display:none">
                    <p>Winter interrupted, “11:55 and 42 seconds.”

                    <br/><br/>They were caught off guard.

                    <br/>Winter continued, “As I said, this is a battle of wits. If you’ve solved it, I won’t attempt to conceal it further. But even if you’ve figured it out, you don’t know where the hacker and police woman are anyways. You’ll witness their deaths for real this time.”

                    <br/><br/>Ron shouted, “There’s always some kind of 96 connection to all of the previous murder spots! Revelation! The periodic table! The music! I’m positive 96 is a key to this too!”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l2c1()">“Okay, got it! I’ll help you find it! But… “ Toto stared at the 96 scar on Ron’s neck. “It can’t be that, right?”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button18" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron glanced down at where Toto was looking before smiling. “Nice work, Toto! I’m the only thing related to 96 here, and that means the two of them are in this building!”

                    <br/><br/><br/>“...tsk. They’re in the first floor storage room, if you flip the switch off, the bomb countdown will stop. But you have less than 2 minutes left.” Winter admitted.

                    <br/><br/>Ron grinned, “Even if I can’t stop it, someone else can take care of it.”

                        <br/><br/>“That moment of hesitation answered for you. If you were a hired hand you’d have a response prepared, either to pretend or to deny it. But that’s a reaction I’d expect from a member of the Moriarty family, who have never had their true identities revealed. Now give me an answer, why are you targeting me so relentlessly?! What is the 9 and 6 you’ve been so fixated on throughout this whole case?! What does this scar mean?!”

                        <br/><br/>“That scar isn’t suitable for you. Why, there’s no need for you to know. You’re as good as buried anyways, 6th generation Holmes.”

                        <br/><br/>“You saw the message from me, right? Revelation Chapter 9 verse 6, you’ll get the agony that comes from wanting to die and not being able to.”

                        <br/><br/>“Is this 6 related to the 6th Holmes generation?”

                        <br/><br/>“I’m done speaking of this.”

                        <br/><br/>“Is somebody holding you back? Someone above you? You said you wanted to kill me, but you’re being held back, and you’re not happy about it.”

                        <br/><br/>“Silence! I won’t fall for that! I admit I skewered the hacker on the unicorn, I stabbed the second hacker with the arrow in scramble crossing,” It starts after the culprit is defeated, right? That kill on sight ability…

                        <br/>Shattered fragments flew across the rooftop as Winter activated what seemed like an explosive device attached to the walls of the rails.

                        <br/>Ron snapped back to his senses, “...I feel honored that you consider me enough of a threat to force this condition on me! Tell that to your boss!”

                        <br/>A grim expression crossed Winter’s face.

                        <br/>The voice continued in Winter’s ear device, “The Moriarty Family does not permit failure.”

                        <br/><br/>Winter spoke puzzled, “Brother…?”

                        <br/>“Too bad. I had such high hopes for you.”

                        <br/><br/>“Brother!-”

                        <br/><br/><br/>Bang.

                        <br/><br/>Winter fell off the building with one clean shot to the heart.

He represents the family that has been repeating tragedies like this for hundreds of years… but I have no intention of backing down. I’ll put an end to them.”

                    <p>“I received a letter from 17 years ago.” Ron continued, “Take a look. This was in my mailbox.” The postmark was indeed from 17 years ago, and the writing was faded. The letter was addressed to the manager of Maison du Kamonohashi.

                    <p>“It’s an invitation to dinner at an auberge. They sent along the menu as a greeting.”

<br/><br/>The menu was filled with super fancy food, and the base is French Cuisine. </p>

                    <p>Ron responded, “My maternal grandmother owned the property and my grandfather was the manager. When he died, my mother managed it but gave me the keys after I got expelled from BLUE.”</p>

                    <p>“As far as I know, she’s not interested in that stuff. We have things in common but also a lot of differences. For example, she never gets angry.”


                    <br/><br/>Toto thought back to Ron’s temper.

                    <p>“He died of an illness before I was born, but don’t worry about it. I was raised by my mom, so I can’t even imagine having a father. More importantly, let’s get ready, Toto! The date on the invitation is today! We’ve gotta go, right?”
</p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">“Don’t be silly! That was 17 years ago! That invitation is invalid, and we don’t even know if that restaurant is still in business!-”</button>

                    <p>“This was also in the envelope.” He showed a beautifully cut emerald.
                    <br/>“We have to return it, don’t we? It looks quite valuable. We’re going on an adventure to solve the mystery of this letter!” He started humming his strange Kamoo, Kamoo, Kamoo song.

                    <br/><br/>They went on a gondola lift that stretched across a forest.

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">“It’s almost like we’re flying above the forest! It’s a little late to ask, but what’s an auberge?”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button9" style="display:none">
                    <p>“An auberge is a restaurant with an inn attached, pretty much a restaurant where you can stay the night.” Another person interrupted. “I’m staying there for work, but I’m a little nervous since it’s my first time, so I’m glad to have company.”

                    <br/><br/>“Your luggage is pretty light, are you from the area?” Ron inquired.

                    <br/><br/>“I came from America, but I’m based in a Tokyo hotel.”
                    </p>

                    <p>“I’m a lawyer who travels all around the world, let me know if you’re ever in trouble.” He handed them a business card. <i>Tiger Dan - Lawyer.</i>

                    <br/>Ron handed him something of his own in return, “Here’s my brown sugar business card!”

                    <br/><br/>Tiger laughed, “I’m glad to have been able to have proper conversation with you, unlike with that English gardener over there. All I got from 30 minutes of trying to talk to him is that he brought those flowers from his own garden.”

                    <p>“Welcome! I’m Sakai, the chef! I’m sorry this is so sudden but we’re short staffed right now so I’m running things alone. Apologies for being unable to give a warmer welcome!”</p>

                <div id="button12" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron asked, “Are you the one who sent this invitation?”

                    <br/><br/>“I’m just a hired chef so I have nothing to do with the invitations. Here’s the key to your room.”

                    <br/><br/>Ron continued, “Who’s the owner?”

                    <br/><br/>“I’ve never met them… a-anyways, please come to the dining room at 6 o’clock! See you later!”
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()"> “This mystery keeps getting more complicated…”</button>

                <div id="button13" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Ciao! What mystery? I’m Mia Costa, a high school student from Italy!”

                    <br/><br/>Ron greeted her as well, and asked “Were you invited too?”

                    <br/><br/>“Yes, by my aunt who lives in Japan.”
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">“Your Japanese is great too!”</button>

                <div id="button14" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Thanks to my aunt's influence, I love Japanese culture, and I’ve studied the language on my own! Anyways, what’s the mystery?”

                    <br/><br/>“The invitation was sent 17 years ago.” Ron responded, “And there was an emerald.”

                    <br/><br/>“This heirloom from my mother is also an emerald!” She lifted her necklace.

                    <br/><br/>Ron smirked, “What a strange coincidence. But I guess that's the perfect way to start off the adventure to solve this mystery.”


                    <br/><br/><br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/><br/><br/>In the evening, all of the guests gathered around a table. A taxi driver named Tom Sasaoka, security company executive Karen Lily, surgeon Bill Clark, and… an odd teddy bear.

                    <br/><br/>Ron quickly caught onto the guests’ backgrounds, impressing them, and starting conversation.

                    <br/><br/>The first meal was an edible flower salad – that Ron covered in a thick coating of brown sugar syrup.

                    <br/><br/>The second meal – lobster soup.

                    <br/><br/>As the meals were served, Ron started to notice how the guests were getting unsettled, as if recalling something.

                    <br/><br/>Third meal: fresh fish steamed with white wine and served with a foam garnish.

                    <br/><br/>The fourth meal is three kinds of roasted wild game.

                    <br/><br/>Dr. Clark stood up quickly after eating, “Sorry, but I’m exhausted… I’ll head back to my room and rest. The food was great!”

                    <br/><br/>“That’s too bad…” Sakai the chef sighed, “There’s cake made with chestnut mousse.”

                    <br/><br/>All of the guests suddenly started making excuses to not eat, when suddenly, the gardener spoke up.

                    <br/><br/>“If only I hadn’t driven my truck that day… I shouldn’t have come to this place!” said the gardener, who was named Lenny Gardner.
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">“What’s going on…?”</button>

                <div id="button15" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron’s mind was already working to figure out whatever was beneath the surface of the tension.

                    <br/><br/><br/>“The food was crazy delicious, but everyone barely ate. Only Mia wasn’t acting strange. It’s like they were disturbed every time the food came out.”
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">“Like… only picky eaters were invited here?”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button16" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron chuckled, “There’s my partner’s reasoning. At this rate, you’ll be a master detective a hundred years from now!~”</p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">“Let’s just ask everyone about it tomorrow.”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button17" style="display:none">
                    <p>	- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/><br/>Shouts rang through the hallway.

                    <br/><br/>“Gardner! Gardner!”

                    <br/><br/>“What’s the matter?!”

                    <br/><br/>“I heard a weird noise from my room beside Gardner’s.” Tiger stated.

                    <br/><br/>Lily added, “I also heard a strange sound, so I figured we’d check up on him before breakfast… Last night’s menu is taped to the door, and he’s not responding.”

                    <br/><br/>Sakai continued, “We tried to open the door, but I don’t have the key…”

                    <br/><br/>“In that case, I can-” As Ron suggested to help, Lily cut him off.

                    <br/><br/>“I can open it, I can handle a lock like this.”

                    <br/><br/>“Hmph.” Ron grumbled.

                    <br/><br/>However, upon opening the door… the gardener was lying in a bed of flowers, with an ice pick stabbing his chest.

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>“Gardner!”

                    <br/><br/><br/>“I can’t believe this!” Dr. Clark exclaimed.
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">“Please don’t touch anything, I’m a police detective!”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button18" style="display:none">
                    <p>Dr. Clark continued, “That’s a shock! I heard something about an apartment manager during dinner, but…”

                    <br/>Ron responded, “That’s me. Officer Isshiki is the metropolitan police’s most outstanding detective.”


                    <br/><br/>Sakai was instructed to contact the local police, and Dr. Clark was asked to assist. Ron pretended to be Isshiki’s crime scene assistant as he lay down beside the corpse. 

                    <br/><br/>The doctor claimed gardner died about 3-4 hours ago, and that he died in pain. Ron looked out the window, and quickly called over Toto, “Officer Isshiki, look!”

                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()"> “The killer came in through the window! The surface is all torn up, like someone tried to erase footprints!”</button>

                <div id="button19" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron argued, “That’s impossible. The window is locked.”

                    <br/><br/>But so was the door to the room, meaning this was a locked room murder.

                    <br/><br/>While Toto thought hard to make sense of the situation, Ron stated, “The flowers scattered around the corpse and the menu are the bigger mysteries.”

                    <br/><br/>And then… an emerald. An identical one to the emerald Ron received.

                    <br/><br/>“I can’t get a call through!” Sakai shouted. “Not with my phone or the landline!”

                    <br/><br/>Everyone had no signal, and Sakai confirmed the only route reaching the auberge was the gondola ride. The mountain road was closed off due to a landslide, meaning…

                    <br/><br/>They quickly rushed to the gondola ride, and sure enough, it was closed off, with an “Out of Service” sign that Sakai did not anticipate. 

                    <br/><br/>Before dawn, everyone was in their rooms, meaning nobody has an alibi. Suddenly, Sasaoka ran off.
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()"> “Where’d he go?!”</button>

                <div id="button20" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Here, Toto. There’s nowhere left to run, Sasaoka. Why’d you run in the first place?”

                    <br/><br/>“Isn’t it obvious?! Because you’re here!”

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Ron frowned, “Me?”

                    <br/><br/>“The dinner menu, the murder, the emeralds, it’s all a plot to blackmail me!”

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>“What do you mean?”

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>“I haven’t forgotten about you!”

                    <br/><br/>Ron sighed, “I’m sorry but I don’t know you. I’m not your enemy, so please tell us more about this instead.”

                    <br/><br/>Sasaoka hesitantly agreed. “Promise you won’t turn me in.”

                    <br/><br/>“Depends on the situation, I might look the other way if it was out of your hands.” Ron replied before Toto could contest.
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">“I suppose I’ll consider it…”</button>
                </div>

                <div id="button21" style="display:none">
                    <p>Sasaoka started.

                    <br/>“I realized it as soon as the first dish came out last night. It was the same menu as when a man I’d met online treated me to a meal in London 17 years ago. Back then, I worked as a smuggler in addition to driving a taxi. The man from the restaurant came to me with a request, he said there was a man with a pregnant woman looking for a taxi, so he asked that I pick them up and drop them off at a certain hospital. A few days later… the body of the man I picked up was found dead in the Thames. Ever since then, I’ve tried to convince myself that the ride had nothing to do with what happened, but now it’s coming back to me…”


                    <br/><br/><br/>Ron commented, “So you were used by the man from the restaurant.”

                    <br/><br/>“He was a conniving, cowardly, cruel bastard! And he looked exactly like you!” Sasaoka pointed at Ron. “His height, build, even his eyes were just like yours! Like how you pour brown sugar on your food, he poured maple syrup on his!”

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>“But I was just a kid!”

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>“That makes sense, but the resemblance was so strong! It’s also true that you don’t have a crescent birthmark on your cheek… The more I look at you, the more you look alike… are you that guy’s son or something?!”
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l3c1()">: “That’s not possible, Ron’s dad died of illness before he was born.”</button>

                <div id="button22" style="display:none">
                    <p>A grim expression crossed Ron’s face, and before Toto could register, Ron was gone.

                    <br/>Toto followed Ron back, and upon finding him, he asked, “Hey, what’s wrong?”

                    <br/><br/>“I’ve… seen a picture of my parents together, and my father had a crescent birth mark on his cheek.” 

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>A flashback came to Ron’s mind.

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>“Max and Molly, playing dinosaurs is boring now that we’re three…”
                    <br/><br/>A man laughed, “You’re a riot! You’ll be a big deal someday, Ron! Even more than me, your dad!”

                    <br/><br/>Before Ron could properly process the memory, a scream broke through.

                    <br/><br/>Another murder was about to be discovered.


                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Last night’s menu was taped onto a door again.

                    <br/><br/>Sasaoka was in the bath with a knife in his chest, and the water dyed blood red.

                    <br/><br/>According to Dr. Clark, Sasaoka hadn’t been dead for long, and the cause of death was the knife, and according to Ron, since Sasaoka’s hair was wet and the water was splashed on all four walls, it seems like he was attacked while bathing and struggled with the killer. They found some red food coloring too that seemed to have been used to color the water because Sasaoka’s knife was intact in him, and the color of the water was far too bloody to have been caused by Sasaoka’s wound alone.

                    <br/><br/>The flowers and the food coloring managed to get an idea in Ron’s head.

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>They gathered round the dining table, and Toto explained the situation.

                    <p>Dr. Clark, Tiger, and Mia were all in their rooms, while Lily was in the garden, and Sakai was in the kitchen. Nobody had an alibi, meaning they were all suspects.

                    <br/>Lily started shouting, “You’re going on about that again? I’m tired of this! We’re getting killed one by one and you still suspect us! Can’t you exclude me? I wasn’t acquainted with the victim, and I didn’t even know his name! We weren’t connected in the slightest!-”

                    <br/><br/>Ron cut her off, “Are you sure about that?”

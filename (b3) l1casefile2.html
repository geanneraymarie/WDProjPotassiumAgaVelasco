                    <p>Toto rushed to the supermarket, alarmed by Ron’s call.
                    <br/>“They won’t let me open a tab, could you pay for me?” Ron said as a matter of fact.
                    <br/>. . . that’s an emergency?
                    <br/>“My cat’s life is on the line here.”
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c2()">“Don’t call me out for something like that! I thought BLUE was after your life! Besides, did you really think they’d let you start a tab?! What have you done until now?!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button2" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron faced the groceries again as Toto paid. “Other people bought groceries for me.”
                    <br/>The cashier spoke up. “You get a lottery ticket!”
                    <br/>Toto takes it, as Ron talks about the lottery, “It’s like heaven is playing rock-paper-scissors to decide which ticket comes out!”
                    </p>
                    
                    <button onclick="l1c2()">“Just spin it already! I’m on duty, you know!”</button>

                <div id="button3" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ring, ring, ring! 
                    <br/>“You are a big winner! You have won a first class hot spring trip! It’s a couple ticket!” The lottery manager announced.
                    <br/>Ron asked, “Since I won this, can’t I just go twice?”
                    <br/>“Unfortunately, the dates are predetermined…”
                    <br/>Unbeknownst to them, a suspicious figure lurked in Ron’s shadow.
                    <br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
                    <br/>“Allow me to take your luggage!” The staff graciously assisted.
                    <br/>“Welcome to the Benizome Annex. Thank you for your service, Isshiki-sama.” One of the staff greeted, but he seemed a little too… familiar. As if Ron had seen him before.
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c2()">How did you know that?!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button4" style="display:none">
                    <p>He chuckled, “Your shoes. The front of your dress shoes are worn, which means you usually run at full speed. Only a detective does that for their job-”
                    <br/>“Don’t be fooled.” Ron contested. “Reporters also run at full speed in dress shoes. He simply checked the registration beforehand.”
                    <br/>The staff grinned. “Just a welcoming game, please excuse me.”
                    <br/>Without a doubt, that’s Ron Kamonohashi, he thought.
                    <br/>The man was a tracking instructor at BLUE named Spitz Fire.
                    <br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
                    <br/>As Ron and Toto soaked in the hot spring, Toto noticed Ron’s 96 scar.
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c2()">“Your neck tattoo is bigger than I thought.”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button5" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Actually, it’s a scar. I got injured all over my body once but only this scar stuck. It’s a number connected to my birth. Wouldn’t you be happy to have a scar that says ‘Grandma’?” He smiled at the suggestion.</p>

                    <button onclick="l1c2()"> “I don’t want that on me!”</button>

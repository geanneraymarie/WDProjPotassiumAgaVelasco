                    <p>Toto rushed to the supermarket, alarmed by Ron’s call.
                    <br/>“They won’t let me open a tab, could you pay for me?” Ron said as a matter of fact.
                    <br/>. . . that’s an emergency?
                    <br/>“My cat’s life is on the line here.”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()">“Don’t call me out for something like that! I thought BLUE was after your life! Besides, did you really think they’d let you start a tab?! What have you done until now?!”</button>

                <div id="button2" style="display:none">
                    <p>
                    <br/>Ron faced the groceries again as Toto paid. “Other people bought groceries for me.”
                    <br/>The cashier spoke up. “You get a lottery ticket!”
                    <br/>Toto takes it, as Ron talks about the lottery, “It’s like heaven is playing rock-paper-scissors to decide which ticket comes out!”

                    </p>
                    
                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()"> “Just spin it already! I’m on duty, you know!”</button>

                <div id="button3" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ring, ring, ring! 
                    <br/>“You are a big winner! You have won a first class hot spring trip! It’s a couple ticket!” The lottery manager announced.

                    <br/>Ron asked, “Since I won this, can’t I just go twice?”
                    <br/>“Unfortunately, the dates are predetermined…”
                    <br/>Unbeknownst to them, a suspicious figure lurked in Ron’s shadow.
                    <br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
                    <br/>“Allow me to take your luggage!” The staff graciously assisted.
                    <br/>“Welcome to the Benizome Annex. Thank you for your service, Isshiki-sama.” One of the staff greeted, but he seemed a little too… familiar. As if Ron had seen him before.
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()">“How did you know that?!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button4" style="display:none">
                    <p>He chuckled, “Your shoes. The front of your dress shoes are worn, which means you usually run at full speed. Only a detective does that for their job-”
                    <br/>“Don’t be fooled.” Ron contested. “Reporters also run at full speed in dress shoes. He simply checked the registration beforehand.”
                    <br/>The staff grinned. “Just a welcoming game, please excuse me.”
                    <br/>Without a doubt, that’s Ron Kamonohashi, he thought.
                    <br/>The man was a tracking instructor at BLUE named Spitz Fire.
                    <br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
                    <br/>As Ron and Toto soaked in the hot spring, Toto noticed Ron’s 96 scar.
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()">“Your neck tattoo is bigger than I thought.”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button5" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Actually, it’s a scar. I got injured all over my body once but only this scar stuck. It’s a number connected to my birth. Wouldn’t you be happy to have a scar that says ‘Grandma’?” He smiled as he suggested the absurd thought.</p>
                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()"> “I don’t want that on me!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button6" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron laid back, and asked, “Did you know about the legend here? They say that to keep the river from overflowing, the people used to offer a girl as a sacrifice, after which the waters would become red.”</p>
                    <button class="interaction"  onclick="l1c2()"> “It would be a huge problem if that’s why the hot spring was red!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button7" style="display:none">
                   <p>“Of course it would be,” he grinned, contradicting his response, as if he was fascinated by the thought of the legend being true.

                    <br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
                    <br/>As they were about to eat dinner while the other guests were in the same room, a horrified expression crossed Toto’s face upon seeing Ron’s food drenched in brown sugar syrup.

                    </p>                    
                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()">“What is that?!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button8" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Rice omelette coated in brown sugar. Brown sugar’s the source of my brain’s energy!” He explained cheerfully. “I drink black sesame paste to counteract anemia, if you’d like to know.”</p>
                    
                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()"><i> He’s like a walking Japanese sweets shop!</i></button>
                </div>
                <div id="button9" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron interrupted, “Let’s play the Game of Life! Playing the Game of Life at a hot spring is on the to-do list I made during my isolation!”</p>
                    
                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()">“Let’s just play ping pong like people normally do!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button10" style="display:none">
                    <p>	- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-
                    <br/>It’s so… wrecked. The ping-pong room was in ruins, and while Toto took in the messy atmosphere, Ron showed a scroll he’d found.

                    <br/>“Look, an old scroll showing the legend.” The image was rather creepy, to say the least. “Anyways, I did manage to find a ball and some rackets.” As they prepared for the game, Ron added, “Let’s play with special rules.”

                    <br/>Special rules…?

                    <br/>Before Toto could register anything-

                    <br/>“The loser has to be the winner’s lifelong servant!” SMASH!

                    <br/>The ball went past Toto and straight toward the now broken window.

                    <br/>Ron grinned triumphantly, “I win!”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()">“That’s not fair!”</button>

                <div id="button11" style="display:none">
                    <p>They made their way to fetch the ball, but it had drifted away in the waters. The evening breeze was freezing, so they just decided to go into the hot springs… until a woman mistakenly walked into the men’s bath.

                    <br/>. . . and the woman was Amamiya?!
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()">I-I see you were a lottery winner too, Amamiya-senpai…”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button12" style="display:none">
                    <p>They all settled in the spring together, with awkward space and distance.

                    <br/>“It’s rather bold of you two to come into the women’s bath.” Amamiya huffed.

                    <br/>Ron raised an eyebrow, “But this is the men’s bath.”

                    <br/>Amamiya rushed to doublecheck, finding that it was, indeed, the men’s bath. Now Kamoo-sama thinks I’m a pervert!

                    <br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/>Ron and Toto later find her drunk, seemingly having consumed alcohol to get rid of the embarrassment. As they checked up on her, a loud voice interrupted,

                    <br/>“LET’S GET A DIVORCE!”

                    <br/>The room turns to look at the fighting couple, but they soon settle down.

                    <br/>“I guess I was feeling a little funny…” The lady sighed.

                    <br/>“You should go relax in the hot spring.” Her husband suggested. She agreed and left to go to the spring. As she left, Ron took the opportunity and pulled out his Game of Life.

                    <br/>“You look like you’re not busy… are you up for the Game of Life?!”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c2()"> “Where have you been hiding that?!”</button>
                </div>
                    <div id="button13" style="display:none">
                    <p>The man chuckled, “I suppose it sounds fun.”

                    <br/>“Would you care to spice up your boring life too?” Ron approached another lady.

                    <br/>She nodded, “I’ve got time, so why not?”

                    <br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/>Ron and Toto played with the guests for a while, until a scream broke through.

                    <br/>They all rushed to the source of the scream, finding a panicked cleaning lady, and Amamiya…

                    <br/>And the lady who had gone to soak earlier floating lifelessly in the crimson red spring.

                    <br/>As Amamiya confirmed the death, Ron was already in the water, beside the corpse, a habit he had. “I’ll avenge you,” he muttered to the corpse.

                    <br/>“This… is just like the legend of the girl sacrifice who dyed the water red! It’s a curse!” The other lady guest shouted.

                    <br/>“The only one that went back to their room before the dead lady was….” Spitz interrupted. He’d been hovering around Ron since earlier, “working.”

                    <br/>“Amamiya. Isn’t that right?-”

                    <br/>“The culprit isn’t Amamiya. It’s someone else here right now. I’ll prove it to you.” Ron interrupted. “You look confused, Amamiya.”

                    <br/>She frowned, “What do you mean by the legend?”

                    <br/>“It was written in the pamphlet given in the taxi.”

                    <br/>“I didn’t take a taxi here.”

                    <br/>He smiled. “Someone who isn’t familiar with the legend wouldn’t use this method, would they?”

                    <br/>“But you know… last night, I saw a mysterious white mist rising from the water-”

                    <br/>“Toto! Here’s the ping-pong ball we lost last night!” Ron exclaimed.
                    </p>

                <div id="button14" style="display:none">
                    <p>“Hmm. The heavy rain the day before yesterday turned some branches, leaves, a rain gutter, and a ping pong ball into a dam…” He looked around.

                    <br/>“There’s a bath mat. Do you think it’ll reach the ball?”

                    <br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-</p>

                <div id="lastOne" style="display:none">
                    <p>Spitz intently listened in on their conversation, but Ron had already picked up on it.

                    <br/>“Wait. There’s a bug on the wall.” He hit the wall, hurting Spitz’ ear since he was using something to listen in.

                    <br/>“They said her heart attack was caused by  the heat shock from the temperature difference between the dressing room and outside.”

                    <br/>Ron let out a proud huff, signaling that he’d already figured it out.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <button id="case2Answer" onclick="l1c2()">case solving</button>
                <div id="l1case2" style="display:none">
                    <p>They explained that a trap was created for the dead lady. The bath stairs were covered with a bath mat, creating a pitfall trap, something she didn’t see. She fell into the bath and died. However, she died of heat shock. It’s revealed that she fell into freezing cold water. The rain gutters Ron had found were used. The hot spring was beside a cold river. And using them, the hot water in the spring was transferred into the river, while the freezing water was transferred into the spring. This explained the white mist the other lady guest saw. Since the leaves in the water were too difficult to remove by hand, the legend of the crimson red waters was made use of. The culprit scattered the leaves on the surface, making it look like a supernatural event.

                    <br/>Who among the following is the culprit?
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="lccheck(this, true)">The husband</button>

                    <button id="continue" onclick="afterl1c2()"> continuation </button>
                    <div id="button15" style="display:none">
                        <p>You might be wondering how he was able to pull off his trap in the women’s bath without being noticed. However, during dinner, the guests were all together, and he likely overheard Ron and Toto talking about how they’d play ping-pong, leading him to assume no one would use the bath, and so, after dinner, he switched the curtains that labeled which bath was for men and which was for women to make sure no one entered the women’s bath. He wasn’t able to anticipate Ron and Toto’s impromptu bath. The switch explains why Amamiya mistakenly walked into the men’s bath. By the time she doublechecked the curtains, the husband had already switched back the curtains. Additionally, it only makes sense for him to have been able to pull this off considering he’s the only one who knows his wife’s health conditions.

                        <br/><br/>It would be soon revealed as well that he killed his wife due to a statement from his mistress, who was the other lady guest all along, a comment about how things would be if the wife weren’t here. It was something he took seriously, seeing as how he killed his wife.
                        </p>
                        <p>Before Ron’s Kill on Sight could activate, he was out of sight.</p>

                        <button class="interaction" onclick="afterl1c2()"> “What’s going on?!”</button>

                    <div id="button16" style="display:none">
                        <p>Toto soon followed after, and saw Ron hanging from a tree, with his arms tied.

                        <br/>“Having you here makes this easier.” said the man who took away Ron… Spitz.

                        <br/>He grinned, “Do allow me to introduce myself. I’m BLUE’s tracking instructor, Spitz Fire. I’ve come to investigate whether Ron has illegally resumed detective activity.”

                        <br/>“I’d already noticed him back in the grocery store. You saw already that I’m not doing anything, right?” Ron interrupted.

                        <br/>Spitz broke into laughter, “You liar! That idiot Isshiki didn’t even catch on to my presence, there’s no way he can do such a brilliant deduction! You did it!”

                        <br/>“Do you have any proof?”

                        <br/>“I don’t need proof, it’s obvious it was your deduction, Ron Kamonohashi!”

                        <br/>Ron chuckled. “I’m surprised someone so illogical is an instructor. It seems the quality of BLUE’s instructors has gone down.”

                        <br/>“If you admit you’ve been doing detective work, I’ll make sure your punishment is lightened.”

                        <br/>“Do you even have that authority? My guess is that these methods and your impatience have a personal motive.”

                        <br/>Spitz flinched.

                        <br/>“Either you made a bet with somebody about whether or not I’m doing detective work, or you were threatened to make me admit I have indeed resumed, or…”

                        <br/>He loosened himself from the ropes and dropped down from the tree.

                        <br/>“You need my help.”

                        <br/>“...I’m no match for you, just as expected from BLUE’s greatest student. If you weren’t, I’d never even make this request. Please lend me your help, I don’t know anyone else who could solve my family’s disappearance! I’m convinced only you can help me!”

                        <br/>“You’re an instructor at BLUE, why should I trust you?”

                        <br/>“I’ll just have to win your trust!” Spitz exclaimed. 

                        <br/>In later chapters, Spitz would continue to be a reliable ally and resource for their cases, proving himself. To read more into this, read the Yadagami Murders case, which is chapters 18-21 in the manga.

                    <p>Ron was cleaning and drying his futon, and it was only then that Toto realized how big they were. </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c3()">“Wow… you really take your futon-drying seriously but… WHY IS IT SO LONG?!”</button>

                    <br/><br/><br/>From a previous case they had, it was revealed that the boat carrying the serial killer from the murders on an island sank, with the entire crew missing.

                    <br/><br/>“The ones who put this mark on my neck during the Bloody Field Trip sunk that boat.” He mentioned.
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c3()">“You’re rather… calm about it.”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button3" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron smiled, “There’s no use panicking about it, I just need to prepare myself and still enjoy my daily life.”

                    <br/><br/>“Hello there! I’m Chikori Monki from Lime Weekly!” A starry-eyed young reporter looked up to Toto.

                    <br/><br/>“I’m here for info about you! The editorial department put me in charge of the new issue’s person of note, so I wanted to make it about you.”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c3()">“Isn’t that normally just for entertainers and athletes…?”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button4" style="display:none">
                    <p>Chikori shook her head. “Not at all! I couldn’t think of anyone better! I did my own personal digging since your involvement wasn’t printed in the newspaper. I’ve always looked up to detectives! I’ll be accompanying you the entire day too!”

                    <br/><br/><br/>WHAT?! A WHOLE DAY?!

                    <br/><br/><br/>And so, Toto found himself having coffee with his newfound admirer. As they order, he recognizes something…
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c3()">IS THIS RON?! “RO-!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button5" style="display:none">
                    <p>“My name is Kamokyu Chasaku.”

                    <br/><br/><br/>You’re obviously Ron!

                    <br/><br/><br/>“The black coffee is just brown sugar.”

                    <br/><br/>Toto pulled Ron aside. 
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c3()">Why are you using a fake name?!”</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button6" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron shrugged, “Out of habit. I’m here to help. The shop owner wanted me to work a shift after I taught him to make my brown sugar latte. I came to help others learn how to do it.” 

                    <br/><br/>He grumbled, “I’ve a lot of free time because someone won’t bring me any cases. Anyways, are you on a date with that reporter girl?”
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c3()">“Wait, how did you know she’s a reporter?”</button>
                </div>
               
                 <div id="lastOne" style="display:none">
                    <p>“As she entered, her eyes went to the magazine rack first, and her dress shoes are worn, and her phone was a lot of business cards.”

                    <br/>Ron continued to serve customers, a new set of which were three girls. He made lattes with cute platypus designs for them, and as they took them away, Chikori was taking photos of Toto, until a noise resounded.

                    <br/>A scream next.

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>“JULIE!”

                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the girls was collapsed dead on the floor.

                    <br/>“Call an ambulance!” Ron immediately instructed. “And… the police. It’s poison.”


                    <br/><br/>- 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

                    <br/><br/>“There’s a capsule with traces of cyanide in the cup of the girl who died.”

                    <br/><br/>As the police spoke with Toto, Ron laid down beside the corpse, observing.

                    <br/><br/>“There were only three people who had a chance to poison her. Me, who made her latte, and the two girls who sat with her. However, we don’t know how they did it.”
                    </p>
                </div>

                <button id="case3Answer" onclick="l1c3()">case solving</button>
                <div id="l1case3" style="display:none">

                    <p>We can assume that the killer is someone who had access to the victim’s cup. The girls with Julie were named Hayami and Tamada. As Hayami brought the lattes to their table, Julie invited them to take a picture. Someone called Hayami after that. After her call ended she went back to the table, and Julie grabbed a cup first, drank, and then died. It couldn’t have been Ron because he wouldn’t have known who’d take each cup, and there’s no motive for an indiscriminate murder. The girls recall that Julie picked the cup farthest from her, leading to the poison attempt’s success. Ron suggested looking at the pictures taken by Chikori and Julie’s social media, they found that Julie was someone who paid attention to her posts, ensuring they looked picture perfect. She posted a picture of them with the lattes Hayami was holding after she got them. The killer was able to make Julie pick a specific cup by tampering with the platypus design.

                    <br/><br/><br/>Who killed Julie?
                    </p>

                    <div id="button7" style="display:none">
                        <p>While both of them could’ve done it unnoticed, they took a photo with the tray of lattes right after Hayami got them, and by that time, 2 of the lattes were deliberately tampered with already, meaning that it couldn’t have been Tamada since she hadn’t even touched the drinks yet at that time.

                        <p><br/>“Julie always wanted to be the center of attention! She never let anyone else…” She dropped to the ground, sobbing. “As soon as my boyfriend got scouted by a talent agency, she stole him from me!
</p>

                        <button class="interaction" onclick="afterl1c3()">“No matter how much you hate someone, you can never solve things by killing them!”
</button>
                    </div>

                    <div id="button8" style="display:none">
                        <p>Hayami glared at him, “What do you know?!-”

                        <br/><br/>“Smash your head.”

                        <br/><br/>Hayami looked up at him.

                        <br/><br/><br/>“Someone who toys with others’ lives has no right to exist in this world.”

                        <br/>And there goes Ron’s fatal flaw.

                        <br/><br/><br/>Hayami went toward a kettle, grabbing it as she prepared to bang her head on it, before Toto threw a sack of coffee beans between her and the kettle just in time, getting her out of her trance.

                        <br/>Ron got back to his proper state of mind.

                        <br/><br/><br/>“Thanks, Toto.”

                        <br/><br/>After everything was resolved, Ron prepared new lattes for the reporter and for Toto. 

                        <br/><br/>“Here you go, officer Isshiki.” He beamed, “Don’t forget that we deliver too!~”

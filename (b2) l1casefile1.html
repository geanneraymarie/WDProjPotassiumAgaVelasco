                <button id="firstOne" onclick="l1c1()"> start </button><br/>
                <div id="button1" style="display:none">
                    <p>"There's only one person that can solve this case," Toto's senior, Kiku, told him.<br>
                    <br/>And that's how Toto found himself at the door of Maison du Kamonohashi.<br><br> He made his way up to the unit Kiku directed him to. Kiku had directed him to a private detective who was... rather unconventional. The detective was apparently also the manager of the building, which made him think perhaps he wasn't very successful in solving cases.
                    <br/><br/>Still, Kiku-san had endorsed him. Ron Kamonohashi.
                    <br/><br/><i>And then again... they were desperate.</i>
                    <br/><br/>As he reached the unit, before he could even ring the doorbell, a voice resounded:
                    <br/><br/>"Don't get your hopes up. Do it yourself! Go back and pray at the shrine again!"
                    <br/><br/>"How did you know that?!" He cleared his throat. "...even if you don't have business with me, I do have business with you! Kiku-san sent me—"
                    <br/><br/>The door creaked open, revealing a messy, unkempt man.

                    <br/><br/><br/>...this was the detective Kiku-san recommended?
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">THIS?! He looked so different from the image Kiku-san had provided! 
                        He used to look so dapper! Cool! This can't be him! He looked like someone wearing seaweed for hair! His eyes were worse than a dead fish's!</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button2" style="display:none">
                    <p>"Does saying your thoughts out loud satisfy you? Well, anyways, do you want to come in?" Ron asked.
                    <br/><br>Still, Toto glanced back and forth between Ron and the picture before snapping back to his senses. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">"Ah, sorry! Yes."</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button3" style="display:none">
                    <p>As he stepped inside, he was shocked once again upon seeing Ron simply collapse to the floor, before realizing that the entire unit was covered in... cushions?!
                    <br/><br/><br/>"This... is the floor of sloth. It knows my daily boredom and despair."
                    <br/><br>Toto glanced around the room. The unit was dull, since the blinds were completely shut. Ron also mentioned that he didn't have access to a TV or the internet.
                    <br/><br>"I'm completely cut off from the outside world. I've withdrawn due to tragedy. I've hit rock bottom."
                    <br/><br>Ron continued to lie face down on the floor, muttering depressing nonsense. Toto felt bad, so he asked if Ron had any hobbies to cheer him up. He handed him a photo... of himself knitting a 100-meter scarf?!
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">"Isn't this just a warm rope?!"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button4" style="display:none">
                    <p>Next, Ron revealed that he had named every hair strand on his arms and created a diagram.
                    <br/><br>"I'm a piece of junk frozen in time. You should just leave. Say hi to Kiku-san for me."
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">"No way! I came to ask you for help! I haven't even said—"</button>

                <div id="button5" style="display:none">
                    <p><br>"I refuse. You're not the first one. I guess Kiku-san really wants me to make a comeback, though he knows better than anyone why I stopped."
                    <br/><br>Stopped...? But Kiku said I should ask him for help!
                    <br/><br>Toto insisted, but Ron kept shrugging him off, as if not caring about the deaths happening.
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">He's so selfish! He probably can't even do a proper deduction! He's just a bottom-grade nobody! "Whatever! No offense to Kiku-san, but you're useless!"</button>

                <div id="button6" style="display:none">
                    <p>"Good idea. You're better off praying for help at the shrine."</p>

                <div id="button7" style="display:none">
                    <p><br>"It's simple. The only place you'd get that pine pollen on your shoulder would be the path leading to Wakana Shrine. Judging by the unopened canned coffee in your pocket, and the sound of the coins in the other pocket, I can tell you bought it to get change for an offering."</p>
                    
                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">"That's... exactly right! This shaggy, stubborn guy is brilliant at deduction!"</button>

                    <p><br>"Your habit of saying whatever you think without hesitation is indicative of a spoiled child.

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">"Exactly! My parents were busy, and my grandmother raised me!"</button>

                    <p><br>"That naive personality is a hindrance for someone in the investigative department. Did you come for help so you don't end up getting transferred?"</p>
                    
                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">"...that's... true too. that only captures about 30% of my feelings though." It's just like Kiku-san said! He might be able to catch the culprit!- Wait, is he wearing... ear plugs?! Just to stop listening to me?!</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button10" style="display:none">
                    <p>ring! ring! ring!
                    <br/><br/><br/>"There's been a sixth detective! Get over here now, Isshiki! Somebody reported a murder at Kazahana park in Shibuya! You're the closest, so get over there!" Amamiya said through the phone.
                    <br/><br>"Agh!" Ron exclaimed. "I told you not to talk about work here!" He finally... stood up! "If I hear about a case, then I can no longer suppress the urge to solve it. But... I can't do detective work so I've avoided it..."
                    <br/><br>So he does want to solve cases!
                    <br/><br>"Solving mysteries is my reason for living... but I've had to stop..." He groaned, "I don't feel so good..."
                    </p>

                    <button class="interaction" onclick="l1c1()">"So that's why you cut off all access to outside information? Why would you go that far?"</button>

                    <p>"I've completely avoided it for years... I have a fatal flaw as a detective. It's kind of like a disease. If you understand, get out of here!"

                    <p>In the past 9 months, the First Investigative Division of the Metropolitan Police Department has struggled to catch the serial killer who’s been drowning their victims – however, the victims are always found in areas far from water, leaving the question of how they did it.<br>
                    <br/>The thing the victims all have in common is that they were heading to events wherein they would be expected to look their best – and yet, they all died looking unkempt, aside from all being men. Their valuables were all stolen as well, but no signs of resistance could be spotted on their clothing or body since none had external wounds. They also weren’t drunk. The locations where they were found dead were all over the place, and we could pinpoint possible locations within the area. However, in that area, there is nowhere that has enough water to drown them. 
                    <br/><br>Despite the police failing to locate the culprit after months… Ron has already figured it out in minutes.
                    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Who among the following is the culprit?
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="lccheck(this, false)">Masseur</button>
                    <button onclick="lccheck(this, true)">Barber</button>
                    <button onclick="lccheck(this, false)">Driver</button>
                    <p id="result"></p>


                    <button id="continue" onclick="afterl1c1()"> continuation </button>
                    <div id="button13" style="display:none">
                        <p>He fits all of the criteria provided. The victims were all ungroomed men, and so they would go to a barber. But how did they drown? Barbers wash their customers’ hair – this already explains the water supply. To make the targets unconscious to prevent showing signs of resistance, the barber filled the sink with oxygen-deficient air. Why couldn’t it have been a masseur or driver? The chances that they would choose ungroomed victims in particular is low. The key clue to this mystery is the ungroomed state of the victims.
                        <br/><br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
                        <br/><br/><br/>“That’s enough, serial killer barber-kun.” Ron called out, as he unlocked the barbershop. 

                        <br/>He had made Toto go to the barber to prove his claim. He made Toto look like the exact type of victim the barber enjoyed – rich. He lockpicked the barbershop just in time to save Toto from becoming another victim. 

                        <br/>“You were about to be killed, it’s a murder method only a barber could use. He made oxygen deficient air by adding hot water to dry ice.”
                        </p>

                        <button class="interaction" onclick="afterl1c1()">“So if I’d inhaled the oxygen-deficient air, I would’ve drowned in the sink…?” He knew what would happen and instructed me sufficiently so that I’d stay alive! “How did you know it was this shop?”</button>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div id="button14" style="display:none">
                        <p>“He chose first time customers to avoid tracing the crime back to him, so we can restrict it to walk in shops in the area. It was also the only shop you couldn’t see into from the outside which also has easy access to dry ice since there was a nearby resource for it. Barbers talk with their customers, so he could easily find out if the victim had mentioned the barbershop visit to anyone. He chose the ones whose disappearance wouldn’t be traced back to him. He totally took the bait, the evidence is all in Toto’s phone. He’d been recording.” 

                        <br/><br/>“Damn it! The cops!” The barber made a run for it, rushing to the rooftop of the building. He tried to escape through the staircase descending down the other side of the building from the rooftop, but Ron had already locked it in anticipation.
                        </p>

                        <button class="interaction" onclick="afterl1c1()">“Why did you kill six people?!” The barber grinned, “For the money obviously! It was a piece of cake! Some rich bastards tricked me before and I ended up with a huge debt from some stocks!”</button>
                    </div>

                    <div id="button15" style="display:none">
                        <p>So it was all because of a grudge…?

                        <br/><br/><br/>“Jump.”

                        <br/><br/>Ron instructed, pointing to the edge of the building. At first the barber showed signs of confusion, but…

                        <br/>“Those who make light of others’ lives have no right to exist in this world.”

                        <br/>Ron’s blue eyes sparked in the sunlight, but his stare felt off – as if he was unconscious.

                        <br/><br/><br/>“Jump.” And so the man followed.

                        <br/><br/>“I’ll jump from here…” The barber got off the rooftop, but Toto followed in time, catching him.

                        <br/>As he held on tightly to the barber, Ron finally snapped back to his senses.

                        <br/><br/>“Toto! Where’s the culprit?!”
                        </p>

                        <button class="interaction" onclick="afterl1c1()">“He jumped after you pressured him!”</button>

                        <p>“I guess I’m really not… cut out to be a detective…” Ron was starting to sweat hard, trembling in horror, until Toto snapped him back to reality once again.

                        <br/><br/>“Quit mumbling and give me a hand!”

                        <br/><br/><br/>“The culprit is… alive? Did you save him?!”
                        </p>

                        <button class="interaction" onclick="afterl1c1()"> “Can’t you tell!?”</button>

                        <p>Ron finally stepped in, free from all anxiety he’d felt earlier. He had his usual grin back on his face as he caught Toto and the serial killer from falling.

                        <br/>“I’ve changed my opinion of you! I can feel unlimited possibilities, Toto! I have a great idea!”

                        <br/>Ron would come to be a detective, although they had to be careful about it. He would solve the cases for Toto,  and Toto would take the credit – not that Ron minded, all he wanted was to solve mysteries once more.

                        <br/>And so began a lifetime bond between two unlikely friends.

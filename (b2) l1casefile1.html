            <h1> THE CASE OF THE METROPOLITAN SERIAL DROWNINGS </h1>
            <div class="level1">
                <a href=""></a>
                <p>"There's only one person that can solve this case," Toto's senior, Kiku, told him.
                <br/>And that's how Toto found himself at the door of Maison du Kamonohashi. He made his way up to the unit Kiku directed him to.
                <br/>Kiku had directed him to a private detective who was... rather unconventional. The detective was apparently also the manager of the building, which made him think perhaps he wasn't very successful in solving cases.
                <br/>Still, Kiku-san had endorsed him. Ron Kamonohashi.
                <br/>And then again... they were desperate.
                <br/>As he reached the unit, before he could even ring the doorbell, a voice resounded:
                <br/>Ron : "Don't get your hopes up. Do it yourself!"
                <br/>"Huh?!" Toto stepped back in surprise.
                <br/>"Go back and pray at the shrine again!"
                <br/>"How did you know that?!" He cleared his throat. "...even if you don't have business with me, I do have business with you! Kiku-san sent me—"
                <br/>The door creaked open, revealing a messy, unkempt man.
                <br/>...this was the detective Kiku-san recommended?
                </p>

                 <script src="casefiles.js"></script>
                <button id="button1" onclick="l1c1()">THIS?! He looked so different from the image Kiku-san had provided! 
                He used to look so dapper! Cool! This can't be him! He looked like someone wearing seaweed for hair! His eyes were worse than a dead fish's!</button>

                <div id="button2" style="display:none">
                    <p>"Does saying your thoughts out loud satisfy you? Well, anyways, do you want to come in?" Ron asked.
                    <br/>Still, Toto glanced back and forth between Ron and the picture before snapping back to his senses. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <button onclick="l1c1()">"Ah, sorry! Yes."</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button3" style="display:none">
                    <p>As he stepped inside, he was shocked once again upon seeing Ron simply collapse to the floor, before realizing that the entire unit was covered in... cushions?!
                    <br/>"This... is the floor of sloth. It knows my daily boredom and despair."
                    <br/>Toto glanced around the room. The unit was dull, since the blinds were completely shut. Ron also mentioned that he didn't have access to a TV or the internet.
                    <br/>"I'm completely cut off from the outside world. I've withdrawn due to tragedy. I've hit rock bottom."
                    <br/>Ron continued to lie face down on the floor, muttering depressing nonsense. Toto felt bad, so he asked if Ron had any hobbies to cheer him up. He handed him a photo... of himself knitting a 100-meter scarf?!
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c1()">"Isn't this just a warm rope?!"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button4" style="display:none">
                    <p>Next, Ron revealed that he had named every hair strand on his arms and created a diagram.
                    <br/>"I'm a piece of junk frozen in time. You should just leave. Say hi to Kiku-san for me."
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c1()">"No way! I came to ask you for help! I haven't even said—"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button5" style="display:none">
                    <p>"I refuse. You're not the first one. I guess Kiku-san really wants me to make a comeback, though he knows better than anyone why I stopped."
                    <br/>Stopped...? But Kiku said I should ask him for help!
                    <br/>Toto insisted, but Ron kept shrugging him off, as if not caring about the deaths happening.
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c1()">He's so selfish! He probably can't even do a proper deduction! He's just a bottom-grade nobody! "Whatever! No offense to Kiku-san, but you're useless!"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button6" style="display:none">
                    <p>"Good idea. You're better off praying for help at the shrine."</p>
                    <button onclick="l1c1()">Come to think of it... "How did you know that?"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button7" style="display:none">
                    <p>"It's simple. The only place you'd get that pine pollen on your shoulder would be the path leading to Wakana Shrine. Judging by the unopened canned coffee in your pocket, and the sound of the coins in the other pocket, I can tell you bought it to get change for an offering."</p>
                    
                    <button onclick="l1c1()">"That's... exactly right! This shaggy, stubborn guy is brilliant at deduction!"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button8" style="display:none">
                    <p>"Your habit of saying whatever you think without hesitation is indicative of a spoiled child. And the fact you didn't walk down the center of the shrine path suggests you were brought up in a refined environment. It seems you were raised by your grandparents."</p>
                    
                    <button onclick="l1c1()">"Exactly! My parents were busy, and my grandmother raised me!"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button9" style="display:none">
                    <p>"That naive personality is a hindrance for someone in the investigative department. Did you come for help so you don't end up getting transferred?"</p>
                    
                    <button onclick="l1c1()">"...that's... true too. that only captures about 30% of my feelings though." It's just like Kiku-san said! He might be able to catch the culprit!- Wait, is he wearing... ear plugs?! Just to stop listening to me?!</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button10" style="display:none">
                    <p>ring! ring! ring!
                    <br/>"There's been a sixth detective! Get over here now, Isshiki! Somebody reported a murder at Kazahana park in Shibuya! You're the closest, so get over there!" Amamiya said through the phone.
                    <br/>"Agh!" Ron groaned. "I told you not to talk about work here!" He finally... stood up! "If I hear about a case, then I can no longer suppress the urge to solve it. But... I can't do detective work so I've avoided it..."
                    <br/>So he does want to solve cases!
                    <br/>"Solving mysteries is my reason for living... but I've had to stop... oh... I don't feel so good..."
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c1()">"So that's why you cut off all access to outside information? Why would you go that far?"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button11" style="display:none">
                    <p>"I've completely avoided it for years... I have a fatal flaw as a detective. It's kind of like a disease. If you understand, get out of here!"
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c1()">(thought) He must've wanted to be a detective so bad but he can't because his body is weak... 
                    "No! I'm taking you with me! I'll support you! Why are you wasting your talent?! Is there anything more important than people's lives?! I don't know anything more important over stopping a serial killer! Just trust me! I'll support you completely! Promise!"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="button12" style="display:none">
                    <p>"Such a pure idiot..." He muttered. "Fine, I'll help you. But... never take your eyes off me." Ron responded.
                    </p>

                    <button onclick="l1c1()"> "Of course not! I can push you in a wheelchair too!"</button>
                </div>
                <div id="lastOne" style="display:none">
                    <p>"Wheelchair? What are you talking about? We'll run to the scene... Totomaru Isshiki. The name's too long, though. I'll call you Toto. You can call me Ron."
                    <br/>And so began a lifetime bond between two unlikely friends.

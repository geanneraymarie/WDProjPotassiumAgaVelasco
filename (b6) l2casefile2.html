                    <br/>- Despite Winter claiming to have already given him his true despair, he claims he must still engage Ron in a battle of wits
                    <br/>- The phone was provided

                    <p>“The phone was provided by them. They changed the time to be ahead of the actual time! And look! He concealed the actual time from our view… because the explosion was on the building, specifically in the screen that showed the time!”

                    <p>Winter interrupted, “11:55 and 42 seconds.”

                    <br/><br/>They were caught off guard.

                    <br/>Winter continued, “As I said, this is a battle of wits. If you’ve solved it, I won’t attempt to conceal it further. But even if you’ve figured it out, you don’t know where the hacker and police woman are anyways. You’ll witness their deaths for real this time.”

                    <br/><br/>Ron shouted, “There’s always some kind of 96 connection to all of the previous murder spots! Revelation! The periodic table! The music! I’m positive 96 is a key to this too!”

                <div id="button18" style="display:none">
                    <p>Ron glanced down at where Toto was looking before smiling. “Nice work, Toto! I’m the only thing related to 96 here, and that means the two of them are in this building!”

                    <br/><br/><br/>“...tsk. They’re in the first floor storage room, if you flip the switch off, the bomb countdown will stop. But you have less than 2 minutes left.” Winter admitted.
                    </p>

                    <p>“It’s pointless, the elevators take too long. Guess you didn’t finish in time, Ron Kamonohashi. The lives you could’ve saved if you’d only solved it sooner are about to be blown away. Are you savoring your worthlessness as a detective, trapped here, unable to do anything?” Winter taunted.

                    <br/><br/>Ron grinned, “Even if I can’t stop it, someone else can take care of it.”

                    <p>Time is ticking. They cannot access anyone through the phone, which seems to be their only way of communication. The elevators are too slow, and the building cannot be jumped off of without dying. How can Ron manage to stop the bomb?

                    <br/>Open ended question. Think back to previous details in the cases – every one counts.

                        <p>“What?!” Winter said in confusion, “What’s going on?!”

                        <br/><br/>“You know, a smart phone isn’t the only way to contact the outside. If this was a battle of wits against me, then you’ve lost, Mr. Moriarty.” Ron added, “I just want to confirm… are you related to the crime king Moriarty?”

                        <br/><br/>“...why would I answer that?”

                        <br/><br/>“That moment of hesitation answered for you. If you were a hired hand you’d have a response prepared, either to pretend or to deny it. But that’s a reaction I’d expect from a member of the Moriarty family, who have never had their true identities revealed. Now give me an answer, why are you targeting me so relentlessly?! What is the 9 and 6 you’ve been so fixated on throughout this whole case?! What does this scar mean?!”

                        <br/><br/>“That scar isn’t suitable for you. Why, there’s no need for you to know. You’re as good as buried anyways, 6th generation Holmes.”

                        <br/><br/>“What do you mean?!”

                        <br/><br/>“You saw the message from me, right? Revelation Chapter 9 verse 6, you’ll get the agony that comes from wanting to die and not being able to.”

                        <br/><br/>“Is this 6 related to the 6th Holmes generation?”

                        <br/><br/>“I’m done speaking of this.”

                        <br/><br/>“Is somebody holding you back? Someone above you? You said you wanted to kill me, but you’re being held back, and you’re not happy about it.”

                        <br/><br/>“Silence! I won’t fall for that! I admit I skewered the hacker on the unicorn, I stabbed the second hacker with the arrow in scramble crossing,” It starts after the culprit is defeated, right? That kill on sight ability…

                        <br/><br/><br/><br/>“Jump.”

                        <br/>Winter huffed. “It is just as they reported. I’ve already prepared a defense against it.”

                        <br/><br/><br/>Ron repeated, “Jump.”

                        <br/>“I don’t take orders from you.”

                        <br/>Shattered fragments flew across the rooftop as Winter activated what seemed like an explosive device attached to the walls of the rails.

                        <br/>Ron snapped back to his senses, “...I feel honored that you consider me enough of a threat to force this condition on me! Tell that to your boss!”

                        <br/>“Don’t push your luck, Kamonohashi! You won’t get a second chance!-”

                        <br/><i>You’re the one who won’t get a second chance, Winter.</i>

                        <br/>A grim expression crossed Winter’s face.

                        <br/>The voice continued in Winter’s ear device, “The Moriarty Family does not permit failure.”

                        <br/><br/>Winter spoke puzzled, “Brother…?”

                        <br/>“Too bad. I had such high hopes for you.”

                        <br/><br/>“Brother!-”

                        <br/><br/><br/>Bang.

                        <br/><br/>Winter fell off the building with one clean shot to the heart.

                        <br/><br/>Spitz thought back, “Come to think of it, I intercepted a transmission he received just before he fell… someone called him Winter.”

                        <br/>“Could be a codename, he was fair when it came to mysteries, so I could almost feel the M family’s conscience through him… but so did I also feel the overwhelming darkness that loomed above him.

He represents the family that has been repeating tragedies like this for hundreds of years… but I have no intention of backing down. I’ll put an end to them.”
